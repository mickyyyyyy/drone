# Propellers

## Overview ##
This folder contains propeller designs for the propulsion subsystem for the drone. 

## Progress ##
The current progress for the propellers includes:  
  
- [x] A basic angled propeller design.  
- [x] A curved propeller design.  

## Future Additions ##
In terms of future additions, we aim to:  

- [ ] Complete a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) on the basic angled propeller design based on expected loads.
- [ ] Complete an FEA on the curved propeller design based on expected loads.
- [ ] Adjust the design based on fixed parameters (i.e. standard sized shafts etc.)

## Viewing the model ##
In order to view the desired version of propeller, open the folder, and the latest version `.ipt` file in Autodesk Inventor.
